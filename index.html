                  Hello, I'm Justin Salsbery.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I'm a computer science student graduating from Gonzaga University this spring.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I'm from the Spokane area, but I've previously lived in the Boise and Seattle areas.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I'm interested in most things computer. I don't have a particular expertise yet,
                  I simply want to learn.
               </p>

               <h3>Language Project</h3>
               <p>
                  I'm (slowly) building a general purpose programming language.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Originally building a language sounded like fun and I thought, 
                  "Surely a fairly simple language would be quick enough to develop."
               </p>
               <p>
                  Since then I've gotten distracted with syntax and weird language quirks
                  that I didn't realize were things.
               </p>
               <p>
                  As much as Java string comparisons bother me, I've come to appreciate Java (and other languages)
                  more through my work here.
               </p>   
            </div>

            <div class="block">
               <h3>iOS Souls-like</h3>
               <p>
                  This is an ongoing project that I intend to circle back around to next year.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I've been contemplating the game's design for a while now, and I definitely
                  underestimated the amount of art I'd need to draw for this.
               </p>
               <p>
                  This will probably take a few years of work, on and off.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I'm trying to keep the scope limited, but I've been struggling to find the time.
